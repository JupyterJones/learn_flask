"Let the awareness of life's impermanence drive you to rise above your limitations,  striving for greatness in the face of mortality. "
This empowering quote reminds us that life's impermanence is not a cause for despair but an incentive for growth. 
By acknowledging our limited time on Earth,  we are motivated to transcend our boundaries,  pursue our passions,  and leave a positive mark on the world. 
Embrace the finite nature of life as a catalyst for self-improvement and embrace the opportunity to create a lasting legacy.
